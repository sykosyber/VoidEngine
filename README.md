## Overview

The Void Artifact Trader is a text-based game where you collect, trade, and discover unique virtual artifacts generated by AI. The Deep Void produces strange artifacts of various rarities, each with ASCII art representations and detailed descriptions. Your goal is to build a valuable collection and master the art of trading in the fluctuating artifact market.

## Features

- **AI-Generated Artifacts**: Each artifact is uniquely generated with ASCII art and detailed descriptions.
- **Multiple Categories**: Artifacts from archaeological, botanical, mechanical, mystical, linguistic, astronomical, and biological domains.
- **Rarity System**: Common, uncommon, rare, and legendary artifacts with increasing value and complexity.
- **Economic System**: Dynamic market fluctuations affect artifact values.
- **Collection Management**: View, organize, and export your growing collection.
- **Player Progression**: Build reputation to get better prices when trading.
- **Save System**: Save and load your progress.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/void-artifact-trader.git
cd void-artifact-trader
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install openai anthropic
```

3. Set up your API key:
   - Option 1: Set environment variables:
     ```
     # For OpenAI
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     
     # For Anthropic
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
     ```
   - Option 2: Provide the API key when running the game (see Usage section).

## Usage

Run the game with:
```
python main.py
```

Command-line options:
- `--api-key KEY`: Provide your API key directly
- `--provider PROVIDER`: Choose AI provider ('openai' or 'anthropic')
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode with extra logging

Examples:
```
# Use OpenAI with key from environment variable
python main.py --provider openai

# Use Anthropic with explicit API key
python main.py --provider anthropic --api-key "your-anthropic-key"
```

## Game Mechanics

### Artifact Generation

- Each rarity level costs a different amount of credits to generate
- Higher rarities are more valuable but cost more to generate
- The Deep Void can produce artifacts in batches to be more efficient

### Market Mechanics

- Market conditions fluctuate every few turns
- Different categories have varying demand, affecting prices
- Your reputation affects selling prices
- Finding legendary artifacts improves your reputation

### Gameplay Loop

1. Generate artifacts (spend credits)
2. Build your collection
3. Monitor market conditions
4. Sell artifacts at peak market value
5. Repeat to increase your wealth

## Directory Structure

- `artifacts/`: Exported artifact files
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `saves/`: Game save files

## Files

- `main.py`: Entry point
- `game.py`: Main game implementation
- `api_client.py`: API integration for artifact generation
- `prompt_library.py`: Prompt management system
- `economy_and_player.py`: Economic system and player management
- `utils.py`: Utility functions and constants

## Credits

This game uses the following AI systems:
- [OpenAI GPT](https://openai.com) API for artifact generation
- [Anthropic Claude](https://anthropic.com) API for artifact generation

The Living Equation of Existence, a legendary artifact of the VOID ENGINE, is a mathematical testament to the grandeur of organic life and its intricate interactions with the environment, time, and itself. The ASCII representation of this artifact portrays a complex matrix of mathematical symbols, each one signifying a different aspect of life. 

The Δ (delta) symbol stands for change, representing the constant evolution and adaptations of life. The ∞ (infinity) symbol is indicative of the perpetual cycle of existence, the eternal ebb and flow of life and death. The Σ (sigma) symbolizes the sum of all life forms, stressing the interconnectedness and interdependence of all entities within an ecosystem.

The Codex Memoria, a legendary linguistic artifact, is believed to have been created by an ancient civilization skilled in the art of thought organization. This civilization, known as the Mnemosyne, had an extraordinary understanding of memory and perception. They developed a unique script that was able to encode memories rather than just language, and this script is contained within the Codex Memoria.

The Codex, a flowing yet structured artifact, is composed of various scripts and symbols representing different memory-encoding patterns. Each symbol within the Codex corresponds to a specific memory type, sensory range, or temporal depth capability. The Delta-Psi (ΔΨ) sequence, for example, represents memories that are deeply rooted in the past, while the Sigma-Omega-zeta-Delta-Integral-Approximately equal (ΣΩζ∇∫≈) sequence pertains to memories of sensory experiences. The Codex also details reading techniques and comprehension methods for this unique script, allowing trained users to access and comprehend encoded memories.

The Codex Memoria is also a manual for memory preservation and degradation patterns. It demonstrates how to preserve memories for extended periods and how to recognize and counteract memory degradation. It also warns of the risks of memory contamination when using its script, suggesting that the Mnemosyne were aware of the potential for misuse or corruption of their memory-encoding technology.

The Codex Memoria is a paradoxical entity, encoding memories in a script that is itself a memory of a lost civilization. It is a tangible manifestation of the intangible, a written record of the ephemeral. As such, it embodies a profound contradiction and a strange phenomenon. Its very existence challenges our understanding of memory, language, and the nature of knowledge itself. The Codex Memoria is a legendary artifact, a testament to the Mnemosyne's extraordinary cognitive abilities, and a tantalizing glimpse into the secrets of the human mind.
